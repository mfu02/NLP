# NLP
What is the current perception of LoL's twitter analysts on the state of the game? What areas are the most complained about? What does everyone have a positive perception of that isn't seen in the meta right now?
TODO:
Pull Tweets of LS, IWDominate, Molucule, Caedrel
Filter non-League of Legends tweets out
Classify tweets into item tweets, champions tweets, macro tweets
Classify each categroy into positive and negative
Determine which category has the most positive tweets, and which category has the most negative tweets
See if the positive/negative tweets have certain correlations (certain items only have negative tweets, certain champions only have positive tweets)


Possible implications:
Possible change in how the game is played

Potential Problems:
Difficulty classifying tweets due to sarcasm in tweets
